# To actually have your app use this file, you need to RENAME the file to db_credentials.py
# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the webapp.py to interact with the database
# You can also use environment variables

# For Local Devlelopment
# host = 'localhost'
# user = 'root'                                   # can be different if you set up another username in your MySQL installation
# passwd = 'nottellingyou'                        # set accordingly
# db = 'bsg'


# For OSU Flip Servers

host = 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu'      # MUST BE THIS
user = ''                   # don't forget the CS_340 prefix
passwd = ''               # should only be 4 digits if default
db = ''
